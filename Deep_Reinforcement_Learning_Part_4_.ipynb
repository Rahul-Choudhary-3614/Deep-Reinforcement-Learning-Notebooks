        "Like SARSA, DQN is a value-based temporal difference (TD) algorithm that approximates the Q-function. The learned Q-function is then used by an agent to select actions. However, DQN learns a different Q-function compared to SARSA — the optimal Q- function instead of the Q-function for the current policy. This small but crucial change improves the stability and speed of learning.SARSA is an on-policy algorithm whereas DQN is an off-policy algorithm which means that DQN can learn from experiences gathered by any agent.DQN makes it possible to de-correlate and re-use experiences by sampling random batches from a large experience replay memory and allows for multiple parameter updates using the same batch."

        "First, an agent still faces the exploration-exploitation trade-off discussed in the last notebook(Deep Reinforcement Learning- Part-3 ). An agent should rapidly explore the state-action space at the beginning of training to increase the chances of discovering good ways to act in an environment. As training progress and the agent learns more, an agent should gradually decrease the rate of exploration and spend more time exploiting what it has learned. This improves the efficiency of training as the agent focuses on better actions.\n",
        "Second, if the state-action space is very large because it consists of continuous values or is discrete with high dimensionality1, then it will be intractable to experience all (s, a) pairs, even once. In these cases, Q-values for the unvisited (s, a) pairs may be no better than random guessing. Fortunately, function approximation with neural networks mitigates this problem because they can generalize from visited (s, a) pairs to similar states and actions. However, this does not completely solve the problem. There may still be parts of the state-action space that are far away and very different from the states and actions an agent has experienced. A neural network is unlikely to generalize well in these cases and the estimated Q-values may be inaccurate."

First, if a network receives inputs that are significantly different from the inputs it has been trained on, it is unlikely to produce good outputs. Generalization is typically much better in small neighborhoods of the input space surrounding the training data. Second, neural networks are likely to generalize poorly if the function they are approximating has sharp discontinuities. This is because neural networks implicitly assume that the input space is locally smooth. If the inputs x and x′ are similar, then the corresponding outputs y and y′ should also be similar."

High values of τ (e.g τ = 5) encourage the probability distribution to be closer to a uniform distribution. This results in an agent acting very randomly. Low values of τ (e.g. 0.1) increase the probability of the action corresponding to the largest Q-value, and so the agent will act more greedily. τ = 1 reduces to the softmax function. Adjusting the value of τ during training balances exploration and exploitation. High values of τ at the beginning of training will encourage exploration. As τ is decreased over time, the policy will approximate the greedy policy more closely.\n",

Each time an agent selects an action, it samples a from the probability distribution over the actions generated by the Boltzmann policy. Instead of acting randomly with probability ∊, the agent selects action a with probability $p_{Boltzmann}(a|s)$ so actions with higher Q-values are more likely to be chosen. Even if an agent does not select the Q-maximizing action, they are more likely to select the second than the third or fourth-best action. A Boltzmann policy also results in a smoother relationship between Q-value estimates and action probabilities compared to an ∊-greedy policy.\n",

One way to tackle this problem with the Boltzmann policy is to use a large value for τ at the beginning of training so that the action probability distribution is more uniform. As training progresses and the agent learns more τ can be decayed, allowing the agent to exploit what it has learned. However, care needs to be taken not to decay τ too quickly otherwise a policy may get stuck in local minima."

This is problematic when combined with function approximation methods that learn using gradient descent, such as neural networks. Each parameter update must be small because the gradient only conveys meaningful information about a descent direction in a small area around the current parameter values. However, the optimal parameter update for some experiences may be large, for example, if there is a large difference between the Q-value a network predicts and actual Q-value. In these cases, network parameters may need to be updated many times using the experiences to make use of all of the information conveyed in them. On-policy algorithms cannot do this. Also, the experiences used to train on-policy algorithms are highly correlated. This is because the data used to compute a single parameter update is often from a single episode, where future states and rewards depend on previous states and actions. This can lead to high variance in the parameter updates.\n",

Each of these batches is used in turn to update the parameters of the Q- function network. k is typically quite large, between 10, 000 and 1, 000, 000, whereas the number of elements in a batch is much smaller, typically between 32 and 2048.\n",
        "The size of the memory should be large enough to contain many episodes of experiences.

Older experiences become less useful because an agent is less likely to visit the older states. With finite time and computational resources, it is preferable an agent focus on learning from the more recently gathered experiences, since these tend to be more relevant.

ALE has a lot of games originally designed for a classical game console, Atari 2600) is capable of rendering 60 images per second. But actually people don’t take actions so much in a second. AI doesn’t need to calculate Q values every frame. Skipping Frames technique is that DQN calculates Q values every 4 frames and use past 4 frames as inputs. This reduces computational cost and gathers more experiences.\n",

However, in SpaceInvaders, players get 10~30 points when defeating invaders. This difference would make training unstable. Thus Clipping Rewards technique clips scores, which all positive rewards are set +1 and all negative rewards are set -1.\n",
